 FIND MOVIE SIMILARITY FROM PLOT SUMMARIES
 The dataset is from kaggle.com
 
With the use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this project creates a content-based movie recommender system that anticipates and analyzes user preferences. The system is quite good at providing personalized recommendations because it uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to translate textual data from movie genres and keywords, and it incorporates cosine similarity to measure movie similarities. This system is special since it predicts directors with K-Means clustering and predicts genres with Random Forest and SVM classifiers, both of which are very accurate. Located within an intuitive Tkinter-based graphical user interface, the system offers a new combination of content-based filtering and directorial style analysis. Users can input movie titles and obtain recommendations along with genre predictions. This initiative shows the possibilities of digital movie selection and is a significant achievement.
INTRODUCTION
Navigating through a vast sea of cinematic options is a unique issue that has arisen in the world of digital media due to the multitude of choices. With thousands of films at their disposal, choosing films that suit one's taste can be a difficult process for viewers as streaming services and digital libraries continue to expand rapidly. This choice conundrum has highlighted how important recommendation systems are to the film business, as they improve user experience while simultaneously making material more visible. As a result, our project presents a content-based movie recommender system that aims to provide tailored movie recommendations based on the viewer's viewing history and tastes, thus bringing order to the disarray of options.
Our recommender system is based on the extensive TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which we obtained from Kaggle.com. This dataset offers a diverse range of movie metadata, such as genres, keywords, and detailed director information. Using natural language processing methods like cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization, along with the capabilities of machine learning, our system carefully examines this metadata to find and suggest movies that have comparable stylistic aspects and themes.
The addition of genre prediction models, which make use of Random Forest and SVM classifiers, improves the accuracy of the system even more by guaranteeing that the recommendations are varied and pertinent, meeting the complex preferences of individual users. When combined, these technologies form a complex and intelligent system that transforms watching movies from a passive pastime into an interesting, customized cinematic adventure.

LITERATURE REVIEW

             Recommender systems, which lead users through a customized selection process, are becoming an essential part of digital content platforms' user experiences. Content-based filtering techniques have significantly shifted the field, which was previously dominated by collaborative filtering, especially in situations where user-item interactions are infrequent (Lops, de Gemmis, & Semeraro, 2011). Content-based systems make recommendations for goods that are similar to those that a user has previously enjoyed by utilizing similarity metrics and comprehensive item attributes (Ricci, Rokach, & Shapira, 2011). Movie databases are especially well-suited for this method due to their abundance of metadata, which includes genres, descriptions, and keywords. This event allows for more sophisticated suggestions based on content analysis rather than just user ratings. 
              Content-based recommender systems can now handle complicated and high-dimensional datasets more efficiently thanks to machine learning techniques. For genre classification, algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been used extensively and have shown good accuracy and resilience (Zhou, Yang, & Zha, 2011). Moreover, the segmentation of movies into meaningful groups using unsupervised approaches such as K-Means clustering has been investigated; this event could reveal patterns related to thematic material and directorial styles. While cosine similarity offers a metric for assessing the content closeness between various movies, the incorporation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly TF-IDF vectorization, enables these systems to quantify the relevance of textual aspects (Aggarwal, 2016). Innumerable case studies demonstrate how these approaches are used in practice; because of its extensive information, the TMDB 5000 Movie Datasets from Kaggle is a popular choice for system development and study (Kaggle.com). 
            Numerous research have been made possible by this dataset, providing insights into the predictive ability of various variables and the level of satisfaction that users obtain from recommendations that are based on content. Evaluation metrics like recall, precision, and F1-score are still important for evaluating how well these systems work (Ricci, Rokach, & Shapira, 2011). This event helps to make sure that the systems not only offer ideas that are relevant to the user base, but also take into account the wide range of preferences that the users have. Such datasets continue to benefit the development of recommender systems, stimulating innovation and improving recommendation quality in the rapidly evolving field of digital media
